## 📁 Repository Structure

This repository contains PDF reports of four A/B testing experiments focused on optimizing different steps of the user purchase journey:

1. **Begin Checkout Test**  
   📌 Hypothesis: Enlarging the checkout button will increase the begin_checkout rate without reducing completed purchases.  
   🎯 Goal: +5% begin_checkout, no negative impact on sessions with orders.

2. **Mobile One-Click Order Test**  
   📌 Hypothesis: Simplifying checkout to a one-click flow on mobile will boost purchases without reducing new account creation.  
   🎯 Goal: +15% add_payment_info, maintain new account creation rate.

3. **Product Recommendations Test**  
   📌 Hypothesis: Showing only one recommended item (based on user history) will increase add_to_cart conversion.  
   🎯 Goal: +5% add_to_cart rate.

4. **Payment Information Test**  
   📌 Hypothesis: Introducing Google Pay and Apple Pay will increase add_payment_info and begin_checkout metrics.  
   🎯 Goal: +2% in both add_payment_info/session and begin_checkout/session.
